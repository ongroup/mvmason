MV MASON issues list for pilot site communication

All parties should feel free to open issues, classify them, assign them, and move them through the process to completion. Additionally, everyone is free to change any data that anyone else entered too, to make it more accurate or more to their liking. This could result in data wars, a favorite passtime for some and source of passive aggressive behavior for others. Feel free to use this issues list in whatever way is helpful to you and to the team.

Most will be well-served using this list in conjunction with huboard.com for a visual representation of the information. Feel free to upload documents here as well to help make this respository as useful as we can. We can use the wiki if it is would be helpful too.
